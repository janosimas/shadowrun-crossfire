/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.blue-text {
    color: #30bcff;
}

.white-text {
    color: #ffffff;
}

.blue-border {
    border-color: #30bcff;
    border-width: 1;
    font-size: 18;
    min-height: 36;
    min-width: 64;
    padding: 10 10 10 10;
    margin: 8 16 8 16;
}

.btn {
    font-size: 22;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
