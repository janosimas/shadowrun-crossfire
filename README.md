# Shadowrun: Crossfire Companion

This is a simple Android app to keep track of your party advance in Shadorun: Crossfire.
With this you can have multiple groups and keep track of their races, classes and XP.

The app also has the races attributes for consulting.

I don't have any affiliation with ``Shadowrun``, ``Shadowrun: Crossfire`` or any of the rights owners, this app is only for helping players keep track of their games.

## Building

You'll need [Nativescript](https://www.nativescript.org/) to build the app.

After you clone the repository run this command inside the ```shadowrun-crossfire``` folder:
```
tns add android
```

## Testing

Connect you phone to the pc (and unlock it), and execute the command:
```
tns run android
```

This should install and open the app in your phone, after that you can ```ctrl+c``` and use the app freely.

## Contributing 

Obs: Be aware this is my first app with ```typescript/nativescript/javascript```, don't use my code style as a guide. I hope to improve it later.

Any contribution is welcome, just fork the project and open a pull request.

## ToDo

- Advantages tracking
- Icons
- Background images
- Rules fast reference (fast play?)
